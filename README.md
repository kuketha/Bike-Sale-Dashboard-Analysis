üí° Project Insights:

Avg Income Per Purchase:
Males have a higher average purchase income than females.
Customers who own bikes (Yes) show higher average income than non-owners (No).

Age Distribution:
Middle-aged customers form the largest group among both bike buyers and non-buyers.
Adolescents and older customers show lower engagement.

Commute Distance:
Customers commuting 5‚Äì10 miles show a higher likelihood of owning bikes.
Very short (0‚Äì1 mile) or very long (10+ miles) commutes see less bike ownership.

Filters Impact:
Changing marital status, region, or education level using slicers dynamically updates all visuals, helping stakeholders narrow down buyer segments.


üßæ Final Conclusion:

The dashboard provides valuable insights into the demographics and commuting habits of bike buyers. Target customers are typically middle-aged males with higher incomes, and they tend to commute between 5‚Äì10 miles. These findings can help the sales and marketing teams refine their customer targeting strategy, focusing campaigns on high-potential segments.
